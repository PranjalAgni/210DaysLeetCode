/*
  Rotate Array


Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is
non-negative.

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways
to solve this problem. Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105

// Simple extra memory solution and  O(N) time
class Solution {
   public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int N = nums.size();

        vector<int> answers(N);

        for (int idx = 0; idx < N; idx++) {
            int tarPos = (idx + k) % N;
            answers[tarPos] = nums[idx];
        }

        nums = answers;
    }
